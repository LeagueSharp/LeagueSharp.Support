LeagueSharp's normal subscriptions are limited to 50 games per day. If you plan on exceeding this limit, you can purchase a botting license. The botting license will allow you to play as much games per day as you want.
To purchase a botting license you need to open a [support ticket](https://www.joduska.me/forum/index.php?app=tickets&module=tickets&section=post&do=new_ticket). Please include "Botting License" in the title.
