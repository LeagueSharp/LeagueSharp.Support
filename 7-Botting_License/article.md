LeagueSharp's normal subscriptions are limited to 50 games per day. If you plan on exceeding this limit, you can purchase a botting license. The botting license will allow you to play as much games per day as you want. Moreover, your account won't be locked for an hour if you change your computer.
To purchase a botting license you need to open a [support ticket](https://www.joduska.me/forum/index.php?app=tickets&module=tickets&section=post&do=new_ticket). Please include "Botting License" in the title.
