It is possible that other software can interfere with LeagueSharp. Software which accesses League of Legends in a similar way (e.g. drawings - Curse Voice) can stop LeagueSharp from working correctly. Moreover, it is recommended to not modify your client in any way. If you have modified your League of Legends client please repair it.

Known software that interferes:
>- Curse Voice (either disable the in-game overlay or uninstall)
> - AlienWare software AlienFX (disable or uninstall)
>- TeamViewer (disable the "share window" function)
